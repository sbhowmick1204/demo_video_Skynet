# demo_video_Skynet
Demonstration video and screenshots of  initial phase of our development.

In our initial phase the software is detecting just the person or any kind of activity .
We have also designed a frontend or user interface which will take the surviellance camera ip address and watsapp number and based on that the software will send alert to that number through watsapp.

We are doing further improvements in these and trying to shift from watsapp to any other platform.
A reference notebook which we have taken help for our project.

Please note that we are submiting our problem statement once again because due to shortage of time we could not make a demonstration video and generate link at that time.
As the application deadline is extended we are submiting one again and now this time with perfection. 
So it's my humble request not to consider the earlier one and please kindly consider this one as we have done much hardwork for this.
